@@ Main Lobby (#105)
@desc #105=This place just oozes opulence. The front doors literally stand two stories tall, and are made of inch-thick glass. Looking outside, there is a gleaming white walkway--protected by golden-colored energy walls, to keep pedestrians or their valuables from falling--from here to the train station, nearby. Conveyer belts carry those who don't wish to walk the distance. The glass doors are etched with linear designs, and sit on gold-colored hinges that swing open almost effortlessly.%r%rInside, polished granite floors reflect the light streaming in through the abundant windows and skylights. The room itself has rounded walls, made of a varnished dark wood. The windows and skylights are the primary source of light here at all times, lights set into the windowsills causing the glass of the windows to glow and cast their light into the room. Even in the darkest of night, this is ample light to see by. Near the windows, large plush recliners are available for guests who wish to just sit and relax, perhaps after making the trek from the train station to the lobby and wish to relax while their rooms are being prepared.%r%rThe walls are lined with small potted trees, painstakingly cared for by attendants that keep them from growing too large. In a city of plastics and glass and metals, the small deciduous trees add an exotic flair to the main lobby.%r%rTables are set up in one part of the lobby, and in the mornings, the staff will have abundant breakfasts laid out for guests to enjoy. At each table was a series of chairs, as guests are welcome to use the tables at any time of the day.%r%rLastly, a long desk is arranged here, curving gracefully with the walls, where attendants wait to pleasantly greet guests and summon bellboys to take them to their rooms. Of course, nobody is admitted without a pass...
