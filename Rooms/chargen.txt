@@ Awakening (#135)
@desc #135=Blackness. You don't recall what happened, how you got here. You don't remember where 'here' is. You don't feel quite right. Something is very, very wrong, and you feel reasonably certain that something is wrong with your head... A splitting pain runs through it. ...or does it? Is it actually pain, or are you programmed to feel it? What are you? A human, with the ability to splice your body or add cybernetics? A replicant, a cybernetic organism? An avatar, a digital entity given a physical form by extraordinary means? Perhaps you're a homunculus, a sentient and inhuman robot? Or are you a riph, that most inhuman and alien of creatures?%r%rDo you even remember what those races are? Maybe you should take a look at them, and see if you remember what you are. Go ahead and take your time. When you're ready, tell me what you are.

@@ Homunculus Creation (#122)
@desc #122=You're a homunculus, an inhuman machine gifted with a powerful artificial intelligence. So that's good news and bad news. The good news is, that's not your head, and that's not real pain you're feeling! The bad news is, whatever memory palette your consciousness resides in was recently battered pretty hard, and your systems are still trying to come online. This may require repairs when you're done. And then, before your visual sensors have fully come online, your audio sensors pick up a voice nearby. "Hey! You alright? Never seen a robot take a hit like that and still be functional.
