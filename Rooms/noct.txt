@@ Nocturnia (#138)
@desc #138=This is the main area for the Nocturnia District, so called because a giant dome obstructs any natural light from getting into this area. The area is perpetually very well-lit, however! The entire district appears to be covered by a very sturdy, very thick clear plastic, allowing neon and LED lights to shine through them.%r%rThe street markings and signals are programmed lights, easily visible when driving around. Intersections generate electronic signals that vehicles receive, forcing them to stop or allowing them to proceed through, though signs also appear on the ground at these intersections, providing visual cues for drivers and pedestrians. The streets light up under car wheels, in part for the effect that cars glow in this area, and in part so pedestrians can more easily tell when traffic is approaching and where it is.%r%rSidewalks are equally well-lit, and companies can pay the district management for 'walkboards', billboard space that exists on the sidewalks themselves. This both advertises their products, and lights up walking spaces for people passing through.%r%rPerhaps the most intricate aspect to this District, though, are the buildings themselves. Built to look like pieces of a circuitboard from above, these buildings are brightly luminescent, with neon signs proclaiming what each store is. The walls have glowing neon blue circuitboard designs decorating them. They are also touch-sensitive, so passersby can actually 'paint' graffiti onto the walls of most buildings with their fingers! Such marks do vanish after just a few minutes, resetting the building just the way it was, before.
