@@ Nocturnia (#102)

@@ Main Square (#138)
@desc #138=This is the main area for the Nocturnia District, so called because a giant dome obstructs any natural light from getting into this area. The area is perpetually very well-lit, however! All the structures--and even the streets and sidewalks--in the district are covered in thick nightglass, allowing neon and LED lights to shine through them.%r%rThe street markings and signals are programmed lights, easily visible when driving around. Intersections generate electronic signals that vehicles receive, forcing them to stop or allowing them to proceed through, though signs also appear on the ground at these intersections, providing visual cues for drivers and pedestrians. The streets light up under car wheels, in part for the effect that cars glow in this area, and in part so pedestrians can more easily tell when traffic is approaching and where it is.%r%rSidewalks are equally well-lit, and companies can pay the district management for 'walkboards', billboard space that exists on the sidewalks themselves. This both advertises their products, and lights up walking spaces for people passing through.%r%rPerhaps the most intricate aspect to this District, though, are the buildings themselves. Built to look like pieces of a circuitboard from above, these buildings are brightly luminescent, with neon signs proclaiming what each store is. The walls have glowing neon blue circuitboard designs decorating them. They are also touch-sensitive, so passersby can actually 'paint' graffiti onto the walls of most buildings with their fingers! Such marks do vanish after just a few minutes, resetting the building just the way it was, before.

@@ Stadium
@succ #98=You head off for the stadium. Doing some gambling, or some fighting?
@osucc #98=heads off to the stadium. Is there a fight going on tonight?
@odrop #98=arrives here from the Square.
@desc #98=The stadium is a tall domed structure, perpetually lit by spotlights. Ovaloid, the stadium seems to be the only one in the district that isn't rectangular or square in some way. A series of four entrances line one side, to try and minimize lines getting inside.
@@ Sirius Cybernetics Corp
@succ #93=You step into the soothing lights of the Sirius Cybernetics Corp, the happiest cybernetics shop in Nocturnia!
@osucc #93=disappears into the Sirius Cybernetics Corp's office.
@odrop #93=comes in off the streets.
@desc #93=The Sirius Cybernetics Corp looks about like any other building in Nocturnia, if larger than the average building. Two stories tall, with the standard circuitry designs running along the walls, the glass doors leak gentle, soothing lights from inside. Peeking in, you see a fairly plain, sterile, white waiting room, filled with comfortable-looking plastic chairs, and a variety of e-readers and handheld games for visitors to occupy their time with on the tables.

@@ Stadium Lobby (#100)
@desc #100=This is the Nocturnia Stadium, where people engage in fights...TO THE DEATH! ...well, sometimes. Not really. Fighters who go in have holographic melee weapons and energy projectors that fire actual holographic energy bolts! But this...this is just the lobby.%r%rThe ceiling is high, the walls are dark. Most of the lighting comes from LED's. Not a single clock hangs on the walls, here. There are some virtual slot machines in one corner of the room, along with a couple of pool tables, some air hockey tables, and a miniature video arcade...but most folks don't come here for the awesome arcade action. That's mostly just for folks killing time before bouts.%r%rSince anyone can sign up to fight, there is a window for entrants, but there are seven or eight windows for placing bets on the outcomes of a fight...and while there is a door that leads off to the equipment area, so fighters can be outfitted with safe weapons for the fight, the larger doors lead off to the audience area.
@@ Exits (#97)
@succ #97=You head back out to the Square.
@osucc #97=heads out to the square. Spending some winnings?
@odrop #97=comes in from the Stadium.
@desc #97=This way leads to madness! MADNESS! It's--oh, wait, it's just the Nocturnia Square. There's pretty much no way you got in here without knowing what that place is like. Lots of pretty lights, lots of nightglass, etc, etc.

@@ Waiting Room (#94)
@desc #94=This is the main waiting room for the Sirius Cybernetics Corp, the happiest cybernetics shop in all of Nocturnia! Their motto--"We don't discriminate! We will serve anyone!"--is emblazoned on a banner hanging on the wall, behind the check-in counter. A receptionist sits there, ready to greet all arrivals with a warm smile. The counter itself is made of nightglass, neon lights running through it in the design of a circuit, casting a gentle blue glow into the room.%r%rClear plastic chairs on chrome pedestals line the walls, offering guests a comfortable place to sit. Several round, white tables are located in the space between the chairs, located near enough to be reached by guests. The tables themselves stand on a single leg, which swells from the thin point on the floor in a parabolic bell curve, out to the plateau of the table.%r%rOn top of the tables, one can find handheld video games (for kids) and e-readers. Some of the readers have the latest issues of the most popular magazines pre-loaded into them, and can access the Atlas City Library to download books temporarily. Other readers have Sirius Cybernetics' brochure pre-loaded into them.
@@ Exits: Exit (#92)
@succ #92=You leave the Sirius Cybernetics Corp. Got a shiny new toy?
@osucc #92=heads back out into the streets.
@odrop #92=steps out of the Sirius Cybernetics Corp office.
@desc #92=Peering through the glass doors, you see the darkness of outer space, shattered by the neon lights of Nocturnia. Cars drive on flashing roads, lights flare under peoples' feet, and circuitry patterns glow on the buildings.
